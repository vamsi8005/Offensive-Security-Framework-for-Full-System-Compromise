# Offensive-Security-Framework-for-Full-System-Compromise
Ongoing 
An advanced offensive security tool designed to provide stealthy, persistent remote access and full control over compromised Windows systems. This framework includes modules for reverse shell deployment, credential dumping, privilege escalation, remote desktop exploitation, security defense bypass, and maintaining access.

üîß How It Works
Establishes a covert reverse shell connection for remote command execution.

Dumps NTLM hashes and sensitive files like SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY for credential access.

Performs privilege escalation (vertical and horizontal) to gain higher system privileges.

Exploits remote desktop protocols to access the graphical interface of the victim machine.

Bypasses antivirus, disables logging, modifies firewall and registry settings to evade detection.

Maintains persistent access using scheduled tasks, registry entries, and logon scripts.
